I've read about cheesecake, and if I'm understanding correctly, you're looking to make one with fresh cheese that's been baked into a crisp crust?  So first, I was going to suggest going to the bookstore to find a recipe that includes detailed instructions, as well as maybe a video of someone demonstrating how to make it.

        "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: I know that for employment, many  companies want a potential employee to take a drug test. With THC in particular, how sensitive or specific can that type of drug test be? I know that with other drugs like alcohol and cocaine, they can pinpoint use within one to two days. Is there a way to test specifically for when someone last used marijuana?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: You're right, lots of employers test prospective employees for drugs. While there are some specific things an employer can test for, like cocaine, heroin, meth, and sometimes alcohol, they also look for telltale signs of drug use in general, like unusual personality changes, trouble with motivation, and often can detect someone who is using drugs.  If someone takes a drug test and passes, that means the level of drugs in their system doesn't meet the cutoff limit of a specific drug test.  \nAs for when someone last used marijuana, that is not something a drug test can detect.  It can detect any recent use of marijuana, like within the last few hours, but it cannot pinpoint whether that use was within the past week or so, or several weeks ago.  I'm also not sure if there are any ways for the marijuana user to chemically remove traces of the drug, or if someone could drink the equivalent of a gallon of milk in an hour to wash their system, as was done in Breaking Bad, to remove evidence of recent marijuana use.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Hm, I'm not a medical expert, but there are a lot of resources online about how urine drug tests work. For example, here is an article from the Washington Post. From what I gather, there's a certain detection window, because different metabolites of THC linger in urine, and that detection window is about three days, for a single use. But it can be even longer than that, because it can also come from your diet or the environment, if someone is a regular user.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

It can also help to have experience in national politics. If you'd like to take office at a younger age, you could look into local government such as mayoral, city council, state assembly, and state senate, and find roles there where you can also learn and acquire experience.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: The youngest age that a person can be elected to office is eighteen, unless a state specifies a lower age.

These warriors enjoy feasting, fighting, and glorious re-told stories of their heroic exploits in war.  Valhalla is ruled by the warrior-god Odin and also including the god Freyr, who is associated with mighty heroes and war. Valhalla is often referred to in works of art, literature, and popular culture, and striking representations can be found in heroic late medieval Icelandic poetry and early modern German romanticism.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Valhalla is an important mythical location in Norse mythology and Germanic folklore.  It is said to be a majestic hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin.  In Valhalla, fallen warriors are honored and entertained by beautiful female figures known as Valkyries, who serve as Odin's escorts and messengers.  Many renowned warriors and heroes are believed to reside in Valhalla after death, enjoying an eternal feast.  In some versions of Norse mythology, it is prophesied that the final Battle of Ragnarok will be waged in Valhalla, and that Odin'sworldly kingdom will be ultimately destroyed in this climactic final conflict.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

The 50 stars on the flag represent the current state of the Union.  The 49 stars originally on the flag represented the Union, since the constellation of stars on either side represents the number of states in the Union at the time.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: The thirteen stripes on the US flag represent the original thirteen American colonies which first declared independence from the British Empire in 1776.  These were the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Georgia.  Each of these states had their own unique flag design, all of which incorporated various elements from the British Union Flag, and these original flag designs are illustrated and reflected in the stripes of the present-day American flag.  Additionally, the thirteen stripes are intended to represent the original unity of the states, as well as the continued commitment of the American nation as a whole to the fundamental principles expressed by these original states.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Can you tell me how to make it?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Sure, here are some basic steps for making chicken salad:\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Sure! Chicken salad is generally made with chopped chicken, mayonnaise, chopped vegetables, and spices -- but you can add your own ingredients to change it up, and it's delicious either on its own or on a salad. Here are the steps you'll need: \nFirst, chop up some cooked chicken.  You'll want about two cups of chicken, if it's a single-serving dish.  Chicken should be cooked thoroughly, so either make sure it's well-done or cook it a bit longer than normal.\nNext, prepare and chop your vegetables.  These should be cups of your choice depending on your taste and how much chicken you have, but root vegetables, like potatoes or carrots, are a good option, since they'll add some flavor. The salad won't taste bad without them -- it just won't have as many flavorful ingredients.\nChop up a few stalks of celery, too.  Celery adds crunch and a bit of flavor to the chicken salad.  You can also use chopped apples or chopped berries instead if you prefer.\nThen, really flavor the chicken salad by adding some spices.  Try dried thyme or basil, or minced garlic and onion. You can also try seasoned salt or pepper for more flavor.\nFinally, stir it all up and refrigerate for at least a couple hours\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

        "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: How are kids raised to be bilingual? I don't understand how that works.\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: It's ideal for children to gain facility in both their first language and a second language from a young age, as it gives them the opportunity to be well-equipped for life in a multilingual society. The most common approach is for kids to gain exposure to a second language through constant interactions and immersion from an early age, as in bilingual schools or daycares where lessons and interactions are in both languages. Another helpful approach is for parents to use both languages for everyday conversation and interactions with their children, emphasizing that both languages are equal and relevant for understanding the world and expressing themselves. Although bilingualism can be challenging, with some effort parents and children can acquire proficiency in two languages that will benefit them for the rest of their lives.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Bilingualism is the ability to understand and use two different languages very well. Bilingual and multilingual education and bilingual and multilingual parenting are methods that intensively develop and foster language skills in their children, allowing them to grow up with equal fluency in multiple languages from a young age. This is an incredibly valued skill, especially in an increasingly globalized world, and allows children to understand and appreciate a variety of cultural perspectives as well as broaden their job and career prospects. Early bilingual education, which is a child education method, enables children to learn and use multiple languages simultaneously from the very start, letting them become fluent speakers and readers in both languages from the beginning. In addition, parents who share different language backgrounds often will have conversations with their children using two or more languages at home, aiming to cultivate bilingual language development, along with a potential multilingual ability. Starting early and consistently, this method is a way to ensure your child will develop the bilingual skills needed to communicate and function both in their home language and in a second language throughout their life.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

The key to making it right is that you need to cook it slowly in a skillet, so the milk solids at the bottom of the pan brown and stick to the pan.  You want to make sure it gets really hot, and you want to keep the oil and solids moving, in order to keep the solids from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Once it's simmering, you want to gradually start adding the oil, so that the mixture cooks gently and slowly.  Once the solids have browned, you want to gradually start adding the oil, a few tablespoons at a time, until the whole mixture has a medium consistency.

It's also hard to know if the behavior is actually tied to technology use, or other external stressors in their life.

The process of 'helping take care of the cat' is called 'cat ownership'.  People do cat ownership in a variety of ways.  One common way is for the human to create a schedule for the cat, then place food, water, and litter in locations that the cat can easily access.  Then the human sets the schedule so that the cat's needs are met, and at regular intervals.  Another option is for the human to schedule the food and water, and the cat to fetch it.  This is known as 'hiding food and water'.  In my experience, the best option is the cat's preference, so you should spend time together and find out what the cat wants.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Do you have a cat?\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

        "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: Why is stoicism valued in a society?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Stoicism is a school of philosophy that emphasizes emotional control and fortitude in the face of adversity and undesirable circumstances.  The philosophy is oriented around achieving a state of inner peace and tranquility through practical reasoning and acceptance of what cannot be controlled, while avoiding negative emotions like fear, anger, longing, and worry.  Hence stoicism is seen as an important virtue in a civilized society, as it promotes positive behaviors that are conducive to the welfare of the community.  Moreover, the philosophy emphasizes self-responsibility and rationality, which are important cultural values in most societies.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Very good question!  I think a society values stoicism primarily because it provides a general framework for living a peaceful and fulfilling life despite facing various adversities and struggles.  The ancient stoics like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca emphasized spending time in introspection and developing a clear set of personal values, which can help one deal with challenges and hardship.  Most importantly, stoicism emphasizes the practice of virtue and avoiding viciousness, thus promoting a generally peaceful and socially beneficial society.  Overall I would say that stoicism is highly valuable as a philosophical approach to living a good life despite facing adversity.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.
